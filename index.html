                <p>
                    From a young age, I have loved taking things apart
                    to
                    see how they work. In adulthood, this became a great
                    ability to troubleshoot and solve a variety of
                    problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I pivoted from fitness and retail management into
                    the
                    world of tech in 2018. I have utilized my unique set
                    of
                    skills to work across Customer Success, Product
                    Management, Technical Support, and Web Development
                    teams. I am seamlessly agile and endlessly curious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I find myself happiest at the intersection of
                    troubleshooting and client happiness, and enjoy
                    delivering
                    elegant solutions to complex problems.

                    <p>A browser game of Concentration with a Mexican
                        Lotería
                        flare. This is the first game I made entirely on my
                        own, using a data-centric approach in Vanilla JS,
                        HTML and CSS.
                        I love it in its simplicity. Give it a
                        try!</p>

                    <p>This project was my first attempt at a full-blown
                        API, connecting my films database to a client side
                        built
                        in React. This was my first implementation of auth
                        using
                        JWT, my
                        first (and less than robust) take at API
                        documentation.
                        I've come a long way since this project, and can't
                        wait
                        to learn more. Node, Mongoose, Passport-JWT</p>

                    <p>This site is currently a WIP, keeping
                        accessibility in mind. Upcoming additions will be
                        some fun (but not over-stimulating) animations.
                        I
                        am very much open to
                        feedback and will accept any and all on how the site

                    <p>I had first created this game in Vanilla JS, HTML
                        and
                        CSS, but used it as an opportunity to refactor a
                        project
                        from Vanilla JS to a React App without using
                        create-react-app. I wanted to create a simple and
                        playful aesthetic as a nod to playing it with pencil
                        and
                        paper.</p>
